# Project Description
Many of us have faced this fear: What if I will forget one day in the far future to prolong my ENS-Domain and it will expire and get unavailable.
With this tool you don't have to worry anymore. With the power of Push Protocol we can eliminate this worries.
Just connect to our dApp, pick one of your ENS Handles and set a Reminder that will notify you :)


# How it's Made
We have built an Frontend using rainbowkit/next.js

with the Frontend you are able to use some of the most popular Wallets to connect to your dApp.
When connected to the dApp the wallet will be checked for ENS Domains that are controlled by this Wallet.
After that you can pick one of those ENS Domains and set up a notification that will remind you in time to prolong your domain registration,
here it can be seen how this is done: https://docs.push.org/developers/concepts/web3-notifications
